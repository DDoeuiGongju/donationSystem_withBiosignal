## Emotiv Android example - SDK 3.5

### Note:
- These examples are not optimized or implemented to be used as completed Android applications.
- To report issue, please refer to https://github.com/Emotiv/community-sdk/issues
- *Todo: Performance Metrics example*

### 1. Activate Liecense:
- To get raw EEG data (or Performance Metrics high resolution) from Emotiv Headsets, your Android Phone must be authorized with a compatible license key and have an arbitrary amount session available.
- Basically user need to login to Emotiv Cloud (by any valid EmotivID), authorize a valid license key and debit an arbitrary amount session, then run other prime examples such as EEG Logger or Performance High Resolution. These steps are demonstrated in this example.

### 2. Raw EEG Logger:
- To get raw EEG data from Android phone, you need to have at least one session available (demonstrated in Activate Liecense).
- Each time you run this example, one session will be consumed. It's highly recommended to use [PRO license](https://www.emotiv.com/developer/) while developing with Emotiv SDK.
- This project can only be built/run on real Android phone.
